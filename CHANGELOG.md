# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Paint `linear-gradient()` backgrounds as native PDF axial shadings. `background-image` and
  the `background` shorthand now accept `linear-gradient(...)` (direction as an `<angle>` or a
  single-side `to <side>` keyword; opaque colour stops with optional percentage positions,
  distributed the CSS way) and a comma-separated list of layers. Each gradient becomes a
  DeviceRGB axial shading (`ShadingType 2`) with an exponential/stitching colour ramp, clipped
  to the border-box. Colour stops resolve `currentcolor`. Not yet painted (the layer is skipped
  without invalidating the declaration): `radial-gradient`/`conic-gradient`, corner directions
  (`to top right`), and stops with alpha (`transparent`, `rgba(...)` with alpha < 1) — those
  need a transparency soft mask. Gradients inside an `opacity < 1` subtree are also not yet
  painted.

### Fixed

- Stop rounding flex and grid item sizes to whole pixels (#15). taffy rounds its final
  layout to integers so that a rasteriser does not leave gaps or overlaps between boxes;
  the output here is PDF, which has no such constraint, and the rounding truncated the
  measured max-content width so that text which fit was wrapped onto a second line. Which
  way the fraction rounded depended on the exact string, so the same row wrapped for one
  value and not for another (`1 USD = 0.9143 EUR` wrapped, `1 USD 0.9143 EUR` did not).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Support the `:has()`, `:is()` and `:where()` selectors (#10). Specificity follows the
  spec: `:is()` and `:has()` count as their most specific argument and `:where()` counts as
  zero, and the argument list of `:is()` / `:where()` is forgiving. In streaming mode
  `:has(~ ...)` cannot be decided and warns.
- Support `color-mix()` (#11), in the `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `lab`, `oklab`, `xyz`, `hsl`,
  `hwb`, `lch` and `oklch` colour spaces with all four hue interpolation methods. Weight
  normalisation and premultiplied alpha follow the spec. Wide-gamut spaces and
  `currentcolor` operands are rejected; see the docs for why.
- Accept `data:` URIs and `http(s)` URLs in the `src: url()` of `@font-face` (#5). They are
  resolved through the same fetcher, `<base href>` handling and access control as `<img>`,
  `<link>` and `@import`.
- Support `<wbr>`, and U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE, as a line break opportunity. Neither
  adds width nor leaves a character in the PDF text layer.

### Changed

- Decline a font that has no glyph outlines, with a warning naming the font, instead of
  selecting it (#9). Colour emoji fonts such as Noto Color Emoji are bitmap-only: font
  selection consulted `cmap` alone, so such a font was chosen as one that could draw the
  character, and the result was text that vanished entirely rather than showing tofu, with
  no warning, a PDF inflated to the size of the source font because subsetting had nothing
  to strip, and an embedded font some readers refused to parse. Emoji now fall back to tofu
  with a warning naming the characters. Colour emoji rendering itself is tracked in #12; a
  monochrome outline font such as Noto Emoji works today through `--font`.
- Report only the selectors that actually behave differently in streaming mode. The warning
  used to name `:last-child` and `:empty`, which are correct there, while staying silent
  about `+`, `~` and `:first-child`, which were not.

### Fixed

- Measure the natural width of a nested table, flex or grid box instead of treating it as
  zero (#5). A grid or flex container nested inside another one collapsed to zero width,
  so its content overflowed one word per line. This was never specific to grid-in-grid:
  flex-in-flex, flex-in-grid, grid-in-flex and any of those inside a table cell took the
  same path.
- Let `auto` grid tracks absorb the leftover width. `justify-content` had `flex-start` as
  its initial value internally, which is not the same as the initial `normal` and stopped
  the tracks from stretching.
- Collect absolutely positioned descendants of a flex item, a grid item, a table cell and
  an `inline-block` (#5). They were laid out through helpers that discarded them, so the
  element was silently dropped.
- Keep the preceding siblings of a processed top-level element visible in streaming mode.
  The subtree was released as soon as it had been laid out, so every later element looked
  like the first child: `+` and `~` stopped matching and `:first-child` matched everything.
  The nodes are now kept when the stylesheet needs them, which costs about 19 bytes per
  top-level element and nothing at all otherwise.
- Memoise the natural width and the measured height of each box. Deeply nested flex and
  grid re-measured the same subtree once per ancestor level, growing exponentially with
  depth; a five-level structure repeated 200 times went from 0.15 s to 0.04 s.
- Keep the whitespace between two inline elements, so `<span>one</span> <span>two</span>`
  renders as `one two` instead of `onetwo` (#3).
- Collapse only the whitespace CSS Text 3 says is collapsible (space, tab, newline).
  `&nbsp;` and the other Unicode spaces are no longer collapsed into a single space
  and keep their own advance width, so `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` is three spaces wide and
  thin/hair/em spaces are no longer all rendered as one plain space.
- Do not wrap around `&nbsp;`, narrow no-break space, figure space or word joiner
  (UAX #14 glue), including under `word-break: break-all`. Thin space and friends
  offer a wrap opportunity after them, and U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE now provides a
  zero-width break opportunity inside a word.
- Treat a cell holding only `&nbsp;` as non-empty, so `empty-cells: hide` no longer
  strips the borders of a `<td>&nbsp;</td>`.
- Do not let a glyph shared by several characters lose its `/ToUnicode` mapping to
  whichever character happened to come first in the document. A font without its own
  `&nbsp;` glyph made every space in the document extract as U+00A0, breaking
  copy-paste and text search in the PDF.
- Draw glyphs at the advance width the layout used. A PDF advances a glyph by its
  single `/W` entry, which cannot express the two cases where the shaper reports a
  different advance for the same glyph: the stretched word gaps of a justified line,
  and a fixed-width space (`&thinsp;` and friends) that the font has no glyph for.
  A `text-align: justify` line was drawn short of the right edge by the whole stretch
  amount, and text following a substituted fixed-width space was drawn off its laid
  out position. The difference is now made up with `TJ` adjustments.
- Keep the leading whitespace of a `white-space: pre` element when it comes from a
  whitespace-only text node, so `<pre>   <b>x</b>y</pre>` keeps its indentation
  instead of rendering as `xy`.
